			<h2>Origins</h2> 
			<p>On December 4th, 1986, Professor Emerson Black set about hanging a picture frame in his bathroom. While precariously 			perched on top of the commode, the good professor lost his footing. Gravity, not to be found wanting, pulled the unbalanced man to the floor and his head hit against the sink. Upon waking, the dazed professor began to fervently draw an image on the wall, as if guided by an unseen force. After some time the professor stepped back from his work to behold the visage of a glorious, steaming cup of coffee! At that moment, Professor Black knew he could no longer teach theoretical physics at the local college, but that his new calling was to roast gourmet coffee that would be enjoyed by the good men and women of Boise, Idaho. Later that month, Professor Black founded The Boise Bean, located in the heart of Downtown Boise, and began roasting his special blends of coffee. The Boise Bean has been stimulating the community every day since!</p>
